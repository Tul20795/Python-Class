# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rock Wall PriceFinderBot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This Bot finds the cheapest rock climbing near you.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This program takes the user's zip code and searches the local area for rock climbing walls. My idea is to make the radius 25 miles from the center of the zipcode entered. It then finds the cheapest one and returns that price. And if none lie in the users input, the program will return 0. I havent made anything that will search the internet yet, but since there is only a singular input, it sounds achievable.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will 100% accomplish asking the user for their zipcode.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think i can figure the whole program out (hopefully) but i would like to think the google search of the zipcode and rock climbing areas would be achievable.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome is for it to be finished so i can use it when i travel around the country. I hope to accomplish it all!

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to research how a program would access the internet/ search engine. Then it would need to search and compare its results to the user's input. The radius may be hard, but craigslist still uses that feature. That site is somehow still running so i beleive i can find the skills needed.
